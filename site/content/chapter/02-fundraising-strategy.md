## ​Planning your Fundraising Strategy

Before you start planning your funding campaign, it’s important to think about the strategy for hitting your target.

The easiest way to start is to break down your fundraising target by pledge amounts. For this you’ll need to consider your product or service, the size of your target market, and the types of investors your business appeals to both from a profit generating perspective and sustainability angle.

Let’s work through an example to help us break this down.

### Example Fundraise

In our example Company X is looking to raise a target of £500,000.

#### Pledged amount: £100,000 from private investors

In this case, you already have £100,000 pre-pledged through your own investment network, leaving £400,000 to raise through your SeedTribe campaign.

#### Pledged Amount: £200,000 through Angel Investors

You might look to raise half the amount through the Angel Investment Network. At a minimum investment of £10,000 each you will need 20 angels to invest in your company to reach £200,000.

To hit this target you will likely need to reach around 200 angel investors with a highly personalised approach, based on making connections, setting up meetings and looking for opportunities to pitch at angel investor events.

Now you’re at £300,000 from existing and angel investors, it is time to turn to the crowd to raise the remaining £200,000.

#### Pledged Amount: £100,000 through 100 crowd investors at £1,000

Let’s break it down further and target raising half that amount from £1000 investments from 100 investors. Think about the type of investor this will be.

Are they part of your customer base, business partners or novice investors with an interest in your sector or impact focus?

To reach these investors you might use a mix of mass marketing techniques and direct communication to engage them. For example, send a mass email inviting them to a webinar to see your pitch and participate in a live Q&A.

#### Pledged Amount: £100,000 through 1000 crowd investors at £100

For the final £100,000 you will look for minimum investments of £100 from 1000 investors. Crowdfunding numbers for small pledges of £50 to £100 in the UK tell us that 3% of your target audience will land on your funding page and of those around 5% will fund your campaign.

Based on these conversion rates you will need a target audience of 667,000 to drive 3% or 20,000 visits to your funding page, converting 5% to 1000 investors. Reaching this group is likely to be based on mass marketing, social sharing and press activity and involve minimal one-on-one engagement.

Remember your own funding strategy will be unique to your company, funding amount, budget and resources. If you’d like to run your strategy by us we’d be more than happy to review and provide feedback.
