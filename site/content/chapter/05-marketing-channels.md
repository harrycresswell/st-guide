## Choose your Marketing Channels

Now you have thought about the different messages that will make your various audiences tick, you have different mediums to approach them through. Below are some examples of channels you can market your pitch to.

### Website

promote your funding campaign with a banner and link on your homepage. Keep a running tally of your progress toward your investment target live on your site.

### Blog

share news about your crowdfunding journey via your blog. If you don’t have time to write a post, make a short video instead. It doesn’t need to be professionally produced, just make sure the camera is steady, the sound clear and your delivery is engaging.

### PR

write a press release with details of your fundraising campaign. Make it newsworth with angles like company growth, impact focus or customer successes. Build a media list and pitch your story to local and industry press. Post the story on your website and an online news distribution site, like PR Newswire UK, and promote the coverage on social media.

### Radio / TV interviews

use your press release or look for a related news topic as a way to approach your local radio station or TV network. Think about how you can use your industry expertise to provide relevant comment or insight.

### Podcast interviews

a great way to reach a niche audience, find podcasts related to your company’s impact focus and approach the hosts with a topic suggestion you can contribute to.

### Events

host a funding campaign kick off in your offices and invite relevant target audience groups to attend. Consider external events related to your company or cause and set up a small information booth, or have a team hand out promotional flyers to attendees. Dress them in brightly coloured, branded t-shirts to stand out.


### Webinars

set up a weekly webinar and invite your audience to attend to learn more about your company, plans for growth and why they should invest. It’s a great way to answer any questions and find additional information to add to your funding page to help with conversion.

### Social Media

have a regular schedule of content about your campaign’s progress, include relevant hashtags or connections to gain reach. Engage with your followers and the wider network, provide tools for them to share your campaign and be sure to publicly thank them for their support.

### Email Marketing

to your opt-in subscribers (customers, leads etc.) is a great way to get your message to the masses and sell them on the benefits of investing in your company. Create a schedule of compelling messages and calls to action to send them during your campaign.

### Network Outreach

an effective way to engage individuals and ensure a response. Make it efficient by templating your main message and then personalising for each recipient. Use this same approach for LinkedIn sending messages through the platform if you do not have their business email address. Look for others in the network to connect to and ask your connections for introductions. Update your bio to announce your fundraise and add a link to your funding page on the bottom of your email signature for the duration of the campaign.

### Advertising

Facebook or LinkedIn advertising is a great way to build and scale an audience. Try display advertising using retargeting to engage previous visitors to your website.

### Partnerships and Associations

with an interest in your success will have platforms to help promote your campaign, from joint social media, press releases or emails to their subscribers, talk to them to see how they can help.

### Follow Up

sometimes it takes a couple of tries to get a response from a journalist or for someone to call you back. One email won’t be opened and read by everyone, but a few carefully planned emails with information that is of interest to your audience will get results over time. Always follow up!
