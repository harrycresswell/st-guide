## Build your stories

Now you’ve realised that you have multiple audiences, you’ll realise they are also interested in different aspects of your business and motivated by different things.

This is why it’s important to build your stories, each one of them tailored to the relevant audience.

Key to your messaging is your business, how it impacts the world and perhaps how this relates to current news and trends. Remember the story is not just about your crowdfunding efforts. You want to excite people about what you do and then let them know that they can even own a piece of the company, by adding this message and link to your crowdfunding campaign to the end of any communications.

For example, an existing customer will hopefully love your brand and want to see you be successful and share in that success, which might incentivise them to become brand ambassadors and tell their networks about your amazing offering. Whereas a local MP is more likely to wonder how your project impacts their political agenda: if you can help reduce carbon emissions, this is a great story for your local MP to back. They may not invest but they’d be proud to make your project well known through their media channels.

The following tips are general guidelines for writing your story, which you can then tailor according to the relevant audience. Just like a cover letter needs to be personalised for each job application, you will have far greater impact if you think about what’s in it for each segment of your audience, rather than generic wording.

### Announce your SeedTribe funding campaign ahead of the official launch

Send an email to your customers and network and ask them to pre-register their interest. This gives you warm lead list to focus on converting to first investors. Issue a press release and post it on a newswire service. Ask us for a quote to include and also to share on our social networks.

### Your story, why you do what you do and how your business is impactful

It is important for attracting investment. Spend some time building this story and weaving it into your campaign messaging.

### Share your funding progress and the countdown to the end of your campaign

This will help create momentum, encourage investors and supporters to share your message, and compel those interested to commit their investment in good time.

### Ask your investors to provide a quote that you can use in campaign promotions

Get them to complete the statement “‘I’m investing in COMPANY because ....’ Add these to your website, funding page, to emails, in press releases and share on social media.

### Weave in product or service updates into your campaign messages

This will demonstrate progress of your company and your focus on growth.

### Customer case studies and stories of company growth

This will provide the evidence of a solid business. Plan to add some of these announcements into your funding campaign.

### Look for opportunities to tie in your company story with relevant news stories

This could be around your industry, the needs your product or service addresses or the impact areas you focus on. Set-up Google Alerts to get notified to relevant news stories and check them once a day.

### Risk Warnings

Promoting the opportunity to invest in your business is classified as financial promotion by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means all communications regarding the
